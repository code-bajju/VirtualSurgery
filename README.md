## Installation

To run these simulations locally, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Virtual Reality (VR) headset compatible with Unity3D.
- Unity3D installed on your development environment.

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/code-bajju/VirtualSurgery.git
```

Open the project in Unity3D and follow the instructions provided in each simulation folder to set up and run the simulations.

## Usage

1. Select a simulation from the list.
2. Set up your VR equipment and launch Unity3D.
3. Open the simulation project in Unity3D.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate and interact within the VR environment.
5. Practice the medical procedure and learn through hands-on experience.

### Corrections and Further Steps:

1. **Image URLs**: Replace `https://github.com/code-bajju/VirtualSurgery/blob/main/X.png` with the actual GitHub URLs of each image (`X.png` corresponds to each step's image).

2. **GitHub Repository Link**: Replace `https://github.com/code-bajju/VirtualSurgery.git` with the actual GitHub repository link where your project is hosted.

3. **Steps 1 to 6**: Ensure that each step (1 to 6) corresponds correctly to its respective image in the table.

Here's how the corrected section will look:
